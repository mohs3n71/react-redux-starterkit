This Starter kit helps you to learn how to use redux in a react application and also you can use it to start a new project fast and easy

I've used Ant.Design(https://ant.design) for UI<br/>
Redux-Saga as redux middleware<br/>
Axios for Http Requests<br/>
Jest for Unit testing<br/>
and Lodash (https://lodash.com/) for having a better performance<br/>


## Commands

Pack for development:

```
yarn run pack:dev
```

Pack for production:

```

```
