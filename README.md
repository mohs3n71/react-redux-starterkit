# React Redux Starter Kit

[![Code Style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-Medopad-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Medopad/eslint-config-medopad)

I've used Ant.Design(https://ant.design) for UI
Redux-Saga as redux middleware
Axios for Http Requests
and Jest for Unit testing
and Lodash (https://lodash.com/) for having a better performance
